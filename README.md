# Ringer - Ring Scheduler

Create a schedule for your phone's ringer sound volume/mode. Use Ringer Free to set your phone to silent or vibrate in once, daily, or weekly schedules. It works great for silencing your phone during work or school. Never again miss an important call if you forget to silence or turn on the ringer of your phone.
Ringer is very streamlined and non-resource intensive. Ringer settings are persistent and will load automatically upon reboot and continue working even in the event of a phone crash or low-memory situation - so you can always depend on it!
